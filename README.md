# Portfolio-Website

This is a portfolio website I've made for myself, with the added bonus of learning React and Next.js.

The REST API is hosted on Heroku, and the front end is hosted on Vercel.

When a commit is pushed to the main branch, a build is triggered on Vercel and is updated automatically, with no interruption to the user.
